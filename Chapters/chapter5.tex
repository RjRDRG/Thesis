Plan-driven engineering requires us to create a predictive plan before beginning development.
The plan outlines the project's people, resources, and timelines.
Software design is likewise done ahead of time, with implementation anticipated to follow design.

Agile plans serve as a foundation for managing change.
Agile teams plan just as meticulously as conventional teams, but their plans are regularly revised to reflect what they learn during development.
