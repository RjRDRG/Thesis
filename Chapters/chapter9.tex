\paragraph{Tuning}. The demo application image was built using Ubuntu 18.04.6 as a base image and consists of Spring-boot microservice with a Apache Tomcat/9.0.65 http server.
In order to prevent the JVM from resizing and reallocating the heap memory while Tomcat is trying to serve requests and
calling garbage collector frequently, the JVM has started with a higher heap memory maximum, and the initial heap memory
size was set to the same value as its maximum memory size.
The maximum number of threads for Tomcat was set to 2000, in order to support a higher load of requests.
