\begin{ntacknowledgements}

    The presented work would not have been possible without the help and contribution of everyone involved, from institutional parties to friends and family.
    First and foremost, I would like to thank my adviser and Co-Adviser, Prof. Dr. Carla Ferreira and Prof. Dr. João Costa Seco, for their guidance, encouragement, and the enormous patience demonstrated over the last year. I appreciate all advise, suggestions and the boost to get me on track.
    I would like to express my gratitude to my family, more specifically my mother and father, for all they have done that helped me to achieve this milestone of my life.
    And at last but not least, I’m thankful to Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia and Departamento de Informatica for the opportunity and the conditions which allowed me to complete my education.
