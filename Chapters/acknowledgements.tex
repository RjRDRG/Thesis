    The presented work would not have been possible without the help and contribution of everyone involved, from institutional parties to friends and family.
    First and foremost, I would like to thank my adviser and co-adviser, Prof. Dr. Carla Ferreira and Prof. Dr. João Costa Seco, for their guidance, encouragement, and patience demonstrated over the last year.
    I appreciate all of your advice to keep me on track.
    I'd like to express my gratitude to my family, especially my mother and father, for everything they've done to help me reach this milestone.
    Last but not least,  I’m thankful to Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia and Departamento de Informatica for the opportunity and the conditions which allowed me to complete my education.
