    \item \textbf{Development of the benchmark target solutions:} This task consists on the development of the various solutions to the evolution of contracts in microservices.
    \item \textbf{Experimental evaluation:} This will consist on the setup of kubernetes cluster and the evaluation of each solution granularity, terminal, type, scalability, maintainability and performance via the benchmark platform and empirical evidence.
    \item \textbf{Writing of the dissertation document:} This task involves on the continuous writing of the dissertation, which
    will be done in parallel with the other activities.
